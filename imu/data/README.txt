README

This is to explain why there are two additional files in this data folder, other than the two bag files. 

The reading_locationC.py file is a python script which reads the contents of the LocationC.bag file and converts it into an xlsx file. 

The 5hour.xlsx file is the file which was created using this script. I did this so that it was easier to parse through the data in the Matlab script which can be found in the analysis folder.
