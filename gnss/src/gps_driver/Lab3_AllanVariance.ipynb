    "## Allan Variance Tools for Lab 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Allan variance (specifically, overlapping Allan Variance) is a great way for us to model the noise performance of our gyroscope and accelerometer to get a sense of how our ideal and measured rates will differ. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We will use Allan variance tools AllanTools from the Py Package Index (PyPI) to calculate the noise parameters of the gyro and accelerometer: \n",
    "    - PyPI info: https://pypi.org/project/AllanTools/\n",
    "    - Documentation: https://allantools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n",
    "    - Git repo: https://github.com/aewallin/allantools\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get the tools you will need to analyze Allan Variance with ```pip3 install AllanTools```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Revise your code (make a new .py file) to read in the 5 h bag and break the string into relevant components. You may want to make sure you have some error handling, since occasionally the string from the bag will be corrupted!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the oadev function (overlapping Allan variance) from AllanTools to calculate the Allan variance for gyro X, Y, Z, and accel X, Y, Z\n",
    "    - Use \"all\" for taus value\n",
    "    - Use the default of phase\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate the three noise parameters from each of the six data sets (gyro and accel x, y, z): \n",
    "    - Bias instability (B), the value at the local minimum Allan variance\n",
    "    - Angle random walk (N), at $\\tau$ = 1 s\n",
    "    - Rate random walk, (K) as given by the slope after the local minimum\n",
